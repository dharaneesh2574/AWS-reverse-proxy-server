In this project I have setup a basic cloud Infrastructure to host a crud Flask application

users -> CDN(content Delivery Network) -> Reverse proxy server -> Web server


CDN - is used to deliver responses faster with caching 
Reverse proxy Server - were a open Source WAF(contaier) is used to protect the traffic from Malicious users
